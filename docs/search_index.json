You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction The Covid19R Project started with the creation of the coronavirus R package by [Rami Krispin]((http://github.com/RamiKrispin/). This ppackage ulled from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus repository. Quickly, many members of the R community jumped in, both using it and contributing small additions and fixes - particularly as the JHU Data morphed quite a bit in the early days of the pandemic. At the same time, multiple other data aggregation efforts sprang up, from the Corona Data Scraper project, which provided automated scraping of many many sources online to the Covid Tracking Project, supported by multiple different media organizations. These are but a few of the data sources available. As with any massive effort with multiple distributed data sources, the datset interface varies wildly from dataset to dataset. Moreover, different datasets track different things - sometimes for the same place. Researchers, however, often want to bring multiple datasets together swiftly in a standardized easy to user format. Moreover, doing it inside of an R package environment provides ease of use for data analysts, so that they do not have to spend the time searching the web, downloading, and aggregating data sets. The Covid19R project aims to create a unified interface to as many data sources as possible, providing a standardized tidy data format across all sets. We aim to do this by having individuals (us or other contributors - like you!) write independent data packages for different datasets. These packages will have a handful of commonly specified functions that will read in and reshape the data into our standard format. After submitting the name of the package to us by filing an issue on the covid19R package, we will add the package to our database, which will update all data sets daily. End-users can then access all data sets and information about them via the covid19R package, which has minimal dependencies (we know that processing some of those datasets in can require A LOT of data manipulation). Here in these documents, we lay out both our data standard as well as a general guide to onboarding a new data package. We hope you find it useful, and that it helps you contribute to the Covid19R Project! "],
