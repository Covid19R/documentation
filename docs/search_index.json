It has minimal dependencies, and does not require you to install any of the other data access packages. Rather, it queries our building database of standardized tidy datasets, allowing you to search what is available, and then directly download the datasets that have been updated in the previous 6 hours. library(covid19R) #for examples library(dplyr) 2.1 Finding out what data we have with get_covid19_data_info() To see what data is available, get_covid19_data_info() returns a tibble of all data sets that are available, as well as information about each. This is the same information that individual data packages have returned with their own get_info_*() functions discussed in Standardized Package Functions. In addition, it provides information on when the data was last updated, and if the data package is currently able to acquire data, or is failing. Here is what we have at the time of writing this documentation. dat_info &lt;- get_covid19_data_info() dat_info %&gt;% knitr::kable() %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling( bootstrap_options = c(&quot;striped&quot;,&quot;condensed&quot;, &quot;responsive&quot;)) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;, height = &quot;100%&quot;) data_set_name package_name function_to_get_data data_details data_url license_url data_types location_types spatial_extent has_geospatial_info refresh_status last_update covid19nytimes_states covid19nytimes refresh_covid19nytimes_states Open Source data from the New York Times on distribution of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths in the US States.

For example nytimes_states &lt;- get_covid19_dataset(&quot;covid19nytimes_states&quot;) nytimes_states %&gt;% head() %&gt;% knitr::kable() %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling( bootstrap_options = c(&quot;striped&quot;,&quot;condensed&quot;, &quot;responsive&quot;)) date location location_type location_standardized location_standardized_type data_type value 2020-01-21 Washington state 53 fips_code cases_total 1 2020-01-21 Washington state 53 fips_code deaths_total 0 2020-01-22 Washington state 53 fips_code cases_total 1 2020-01-22 Washington state 53 fips_code deaths_total 0 2020-01-23 Washington state 53 fips_code cases_total 1 2020-01-23 Washington state 53 fips_code deaths_total 0 2.3 Examining controlled vocabulary with get_covid19_controlled_vocab() In our data standard, we have three types of controlled vocabulary - location_type, location_code_type, and data_type. To see what the current controlled vocabulary is (both to understand the fields and to see if we should add more), use get_covid19_controlled_vocab() as below: get_covid19_controlled_vocab(&quot;location_type&quot;)%&gt;% knitr::kable() %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling( bootstrap_options = c(&quot;striped&quot;,&quot;condensed&quot;, &quot;responsive&quot;)) location_type description continent continental scale country a country with soverign borders state a spatial area inside that country such as a state, province, canton, etc. county a spatial area demarcated within a state city a single municipality - the smallest spatial grain of government in a country canton the cantons of Switzerland and Principality of Liechtenstein (FL) get_covid19_controlled_vocab(&quot;location_code_type&quot;)%&gt;% knitr::kable() %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling( bootstrap_options = c(&quot;striped&quot;,&quot;condensed&quot;, &quot;responsive&quot;)) location_code_type description URL fips_code The federal code in US designating regions of governance https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/info/maps/census/fips/fips.txt iso_3166 ISO 3166 is a standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that defines codes for the names of countries, dependent territories, special areas of geographical interest, and their principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166 get_covid19_controlled_vocab(&quot;data_type&quot;)%&gt;% knitr::kable() %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling( bootstrap_options = c(&quot;striped&quot;,&quot;condensed&quot;, &quot;responsive&quot;)) data_type description cases_new new confirmed Covid-19 cases during on the current date cases_total cumulative confirmed Covid-19 cases as of the current date recovered_total cumulative number of patients recovered as of the current date recovered_new new number of patients recovered on the current date deaths_new new deaths on the current date deaths_total cumulative deaths due to Covid-19 as of the current date tested_total cumulative number of tests performed as of the date hosp_new new hospitalizations on the current date hosp_current current number of hospitalized patients as of the current date icu_current number of hospitalized patients in ICUs as of the current date vent_current number of hospitalized patients requiring ventilation as of the current date "]
