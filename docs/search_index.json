It has minimal dependencies, and does not require you to install any of the other data access packages. Rather, it queries our building database of standardized tidy datasets, allowing you to search what is available, and then directly download the datasets that have been updated in the previous 6 hours. library(covid19R) #for examples library(dplyr) 2.1 Finding out what data we have with get_covid19_data_info() To see what data is available, get_covid19_data_info() returns a tibble of all data sets that are available, as well as information about each. This is the same information that individual data packages have returned with their own get_info_*() functions discussed in Standardized Package Functions. In addition, it provides information on when the data was last updated, and if the data package is currently able to acquire data, or is failing. Here is what we have at the time of writing this documentation. dat_info &lt;- get_covid19_data_info() dat_info %&gt;% knitr::kable() %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling( bootstrap_options = c(&quot;striped&quot;,&quot;condensed&quot;, &quot;responsive&quot;)) %&gt;% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;, height = &quot;100%&quot;) data_set_name package_name function_to_get_data data_details data_url license_url data_types location_types spatial_extent has_geospatial_info refresh_status last_update covid19nytimes_states covid19nytimes refresh_covid19nytimes_states Open Source data from the New York Times on distribution of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths in the US States.
