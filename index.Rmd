# Welcome to the Covid19R Project Documentation!

This is the documentation for the [Covid19R Project](https://github.com/Covid19R). We detail what the project is, how to be a part of it, and what minimal tidy standards we want data packages to conform to in order to bring all of our data together!

- [covid19R](https://github.com/Covid19R/covid19R) -  Our main package  
- [covid19nytimes](https://github.com/Covid19R/covid19nytimes) - Accessing the NY Times State and County data 
- [covid19france](https://github.com/Covid19R/covid19france) - Providing data from [opencovid19-fr](https://github.com/opencovid19-fr/data)
